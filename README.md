# ClassRat
A web application for DSU students to rate and review classes.

## How to Use
Just search for the name of the class that you're interested in. Valid formats include both the name and course number.
For example, entering  Discrete Math or Math 316 are both valid inputs. 
Then, just click the relevant class option that will auto-populate below the search bar as you type. 
After selecting a class, you will then have the option to choose a particular class section taught by a professor that you're interested in.
You will then be able to see the reviews associated with that class section. Please leave a review if you have taken the class!
